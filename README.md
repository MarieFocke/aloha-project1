#Aloha project1
The project1's name is Aloha Apparent Co.and is the first page of the website's company. It is compose of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery (carousel, scolling and validation of the email). No link to other pages has been done yet. The focus was on the use of CSS with multiple goals to check. In the presentation, you could see some changes in the item's order, the font-family, font-size and paddings in the titles and the differents details you can add on a background with the use of flex.

I would say that this work is mostly focus on CSS and HTML. The use of Javascrip and JQuery is very limited so in this domain it wouldn't be a good reference.
